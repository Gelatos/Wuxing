A creature floating in the air from levitate takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. A floating creature can spend an Interact action to stabilize itself and negate this penalty for the remainder of its turn. If the target is adjacent to a fixed object or terrain of suitable stability, it can move across the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical, like a wall) or crawling (if the surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling). The GM determines which surfaces can be climbed or crawled across.`,

Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. When a creature detects a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealedâ€”only its presence somewhere within range. The creature can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. When the creature is within 5 feet of the source, it pinpoints the sourceâ€™s location. A creature with the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Survival (Wisdom) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is reduced by 10 with the scent ability. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.`,
